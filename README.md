# Knee Osteoarthritis Detection System

A web-based application for automated detection and grading of knee osteoarthritis from X-ray images using deep learning.

## Features

- Upload and analyze knee X-ray images
- Automated detection of osteoarthritis severity using KL grades (0, 3, 4)
- Real-time processing and results visualization
- User-friendly interface with detailed analysis reports
- High accuracy performance (95% overall accuracy)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn-ui components
